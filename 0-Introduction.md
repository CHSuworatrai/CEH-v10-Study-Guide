## <u>Ethics and Hacking</u>

### Classes of Hackers:

- **White Hat** - Ethical hackers.
- **Black Hat** - Hackers that seek to perform malicious activities.
- **Gray Hat** - Hackers that perform good or bad activities but do not have the permission of the organization they are hacking against.

**Hacktivist** - Someone who hacks for a cause; political agenda.

**Suicide Hackers** - Are hackers that are not afraid of going jail or facing any sort of punishment; hack to get the job done.

**Cyberterrorist** - Motivated by religious or political beliefs to create fear or disruption.

**State-Sponsored Hacker** - Hacker that is hired by a government or entity related.

## <u>Hacking Vocabulary</u>

- **Hack value** - Perceived value or worth of a target as seen by the attacker.
- **Vulnerability** - A system flaw, weakness on the system (on design, implementation etc).
- **Exploit** - Exploits are a way of gaining access to a system through a security flaw and taking advantage of the flaw for their benefit.
- **Payload** - Component of an attack; is the part of the private user text which could also contain malware such as worms or viruses which performs the malicious action; deleting data, sending spam or encrypting data.
- **Zero-day attack** - Attack that occurs before a vendor knows or is able to patch a flaw.
- **Daisy Chaining / Pivotting** - It involves gaining access to a network and /or computer and then using the same information to gain access to multiple networks and computers that contains desirable information. 
- **Doxxing** - Publishing PII about an individual usually with a malicious intent.
- **Enterprise Information Security Architecture** (EISA) - process that determines how systems work within an organization.
- **Incident management** - deals with specific incidents to mitigate the attack.

## <u> Fundamental Security Concepts </u>
The whole principle is to avoid **Theft, Tampering and Disruption** of the systems through **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability).

- **Confidentiality**
Keeping systems and data from being accessed, seen, read to anyone who is not authorized to do so.

- **Integrity**
Protect the data from modification or deletion by unauthorized parties, and ensuring that when authorized people make changes that shouldn't have been made the damage can be undone.

- **Availability**
Systems, access channels, and authentication mechanisms must all be working properly for the information they provide and protect to be available when needed.

**Note:** *In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved. (ISO/IEC 27000:2009)*

- **Auditing & Accountability**
Basically keep tracking of everthing, like, who's been logging in when are they loggin in whose access this data.

- **Non-Repudiation**
Non-repudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. Non-repudiation is a legal concept that is widely used in information security and refers to a service, which provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of the data.

### **Security, Functionality and Usability balance**

There is an inter dependency between these three attributes. When **security goes up, usability and functionality come down**. Any organization should balance between these three qualities to arrive at a balanced information system.

## <u> Attack Types and Vectors </u>

- **Vectors**
    - **APT - Advanced Persistent Threats**
        - An advanced persistent threat is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.
    - **Botnets**
        - Huge network of compromised hosts. (used for DDoS).
    - **Cloud computing**
    - **Insider attacks**
        - Disgruntled employee can damage assets from inside.
    - **Mobile threats**
    - **Viruses, worms, and malware**

- **Types** - Attacks are looking for vulnerabilities on:
    - **Operating systems**
    - **Misconfigurations**
    - **Application level**
    - **Shrinkwrap / defaults**
        - Default configurations out of the box: e.g. - Default passwords etc
